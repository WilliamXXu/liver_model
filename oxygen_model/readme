The main.m program is divided into a few sections:

adjustable parameters\
parameters\
construction of matrices\
iterations\
post-modification\
helper functions\

note-to-self:\
versions:\
1.0: original\
2.1: hemoglobin\
2.2: 3d design\
3.0: increase space/time units, reaction function reduced to one-step method

code archive:\

experiment1: one-step method for reaction function (no improvement)\
experiment2: inverse matrix prepared (acutally slower)\
experiment3: with influx(useless tho)\
experiment4: no oxygen consumption by hepatocytes\
experiment5: faster blood flow\
experiment6: (as like all experiments) fixed number of iterations
archived2d_1: very old version\
archived3d: 3d attempt\
