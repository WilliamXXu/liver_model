  abstract = {To study the mechanism of centrilobular damage developing in the centrilobular region after high doses of acetaminophen (APAP), its metabolism and toxicity were compared in periportal and perivenous hepatocytes isolated by digitonin/collagenase perfusion. Contrary to earlier reports, based on perfusions, no evidence for a periportal dominance of APAP sulfation could be observed. Glucuronidation, the dominant pathway of conjugation at high (5 mM) APAP concentration, was faster in perivenous cells. During primary culture, prolonged exposure ({$\geqslant$} 24 hr) to 5 mM APAP damaged perivenous cells, with a higher P450 2E1 level than periportal cells. When cells were isolated from ethanol-pretreated rats, to induce P450 2E1 levels specifically in the perivenous region, perivenous hepatocytes exhibited enhanced APAP vulnerability and extensive glutathione depletion. In contrast, corresponding periportal cells retained good viability. Isoniazid, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2E1, protected cells against APAP toxicity and prevented glutathione depletion. Induction of P450 2E1 also caused a 3-fold increase in the covalent binding of reactive intermediates from [14C]APAP, and this increase was mainly confined to perivenous cells. These results indicate that in rat liver there is only slight perivenous zonation of APAP conjugation and suggest that zone-specific APAP activation, mediated by the regional expression of ethanol-inducible cytochrome P450 2E1, is responsible for the characteristic centrilobular liver damage elicited by APAP.},

  abstract = {The stoichiometry of H+ ejection by mitochondria during hydrolysis of a small pulse of ATP (the H+/ATP ratio) has been reexamined in the light of our recent observation that the stoichiometry of H+ ejection during mitochondrial electron transport (the H+/site ratio) was previously underestimated. We show that earlier estimates of the H+/ATP ratio in intact mitochondria were based upon an invalid correction for scaler H+ production and describe a modified method for determination of this ratio which utilizes mersalyl or N-ethylmaleimide to prevent complicating transmembrane movements of phosphate and H+. This method gives a value for the H+/ATP ratio of 2.0 without the need for questionable corrections, compared with a value of 3.0 for the H+/site ratio also obtained by pulse methods. A modified version of the chemiosmotic theory is presented, in which 3 H+ are ejected per pair of electrons traversing each energy-conserving site of the respiratory chain. Of these, 2 H+ return to the matrix through the ATPase to form ATP from ADP and phosphate, and 1 H+ returns through the combined action of the phosphate and adenine nucleotide exchange carriers of the inner membrane to allow the energy-requiring influx of Pi and ADP3- and efflux of ATP4-. Thus, up to one-third of the energy input into synthesis of extramitochondrial ATP may be required for transport work. Since other methods suggest that the H+/site significantly exceeds 3.0, an alternative possibility is that 4 h+ are ejected per site, followed by return of 3 H+ through the ATPase and 1 H+ through the operation of the proton-coupled membrane transport systems.},

Finally, the article reviews emerging liver-on-chip devices and discusses the advantages and pitfalls of individual designs.

  abstract = {This review encompasses the most important advances in liver functions and hepatotoxicity and analyzes which mechanisms can be studied in vitro. In a complex architecture of nested, zonated lobules, the liver consists of approximately 80~\% hepatocytes and 20~\% non-parenchymal cells, the latter being involved in a secondary phase that may dramatically aggravate the initial damage. Hepatotoxicity, as well as hepatic metabolism, is controlled by a set of nuclear receptors (including PXR, CAR, HNF-4{$\alpha$}, FXR, LXR, SHP, VDR and PPAR) and signaling pathways. When isolating liver cells, some pathways are activated, e.g., the RAS/MEK/ERK pathway, whereas others are silenced (e.g. HNF-4{$\alpha$}), resulting in up- and downregulation of hundreds of genes. An understanding of these changes is crucial for a correct interpretation of in vitro data. The possibilities and limitations of the most useful liver in vitro systems are summarized, including three-dimensional culture techniques, co-cultures with non-parenchymal cells, hepatospheres, precision cut liver slices and the isolated perfused liver. Also discussed is how closely hepatoma, stem cell and iPS cell\textendash derived hepatocyte-like-cells resemble real hepatocytes. Finally, a summary is given of the state of the art of liver in vitro and mathematical modeling systems that are currently used in the pharmaceutical industry with an emphasis on drug metabolism, prediction of clearance, drug interaction, transporter studies and hepatotoxicity. One key message is that despite our enthusiasm for in vitro systems, we must never lose sight of the in vivo situation. Although hepatocytes have been isolated for decades, the hunt for relevant alternative systems has only just begun.},

The large number of studies in this area attests to the complexities (biochemical, structural, hemodynamic) involved. This article focuses on theoretical studies from the last two decades and, in particular, on models of O2 transport to tissue by discrete microvessels. A brief discussion of intravascular O2 transport is first given, highlighting the physiological importance of intravascular resistance to blood-tissue O2 transfer. This is followed by a description of the Krogh tissue cylinder model of O2 transport by a single capillary, which is shown to remain relevant in modified forms that relax many of the original biophysical assumptions. However, there are many geometric and hemodynamic complexities that require the consideration of microvascular arrays and networks. Multi-vessel models are discussed which have shown the physiological importance of heterogeneities in vessel spacing, O2 supply, red blood cell flow path, as well as interactions between capillaries and arterioles. These realistic models require sophisticated methods for solving the governing partial differential equations, and a range of solution techniques are described. Finally, the issue of experimental validation of microvascular O2 delivery models is discussed, and new directions in O2 transport modeling are outlined.},

  abstract = {Glycolysis is a linear metabolic pathway of enzyme-catalyzed reactions that convert glucose into two molecules of pyruvate in the presence of oxygen or into two molecules of lactate in the absence of oxygen. The latter pathway, anaerobic glycolysis, is believed to be the first process to have evolved in nature to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In most cells glycolysis converts glucose to pyruvate which is subsequently oxidized to carbon dioxide and water by mitochondrial enzymes. However, in some cells, most notably mature red blood cells, glycolysis is the only means of ATP production because of the lack of mitochondria. In the absence of oxygen, glycolysis is the only option that cells have for the production of ATP from glucose. Overproduction of lactic acid by anaerobic glycolysis leads to lactic acidosis, a life-threatening condition. Many cancer cells have an exceptionally high enzymatic capacity for glycolysis. Even when oxygen is available, cancer cells produce much of their ATP by glycolysis. The ability to produce sufficient ATP by a pathway that does not require oxygen gives cancer cells a selective advantage over normal cells.},

  abstract = {This review addresses recent advances in specific mechanisms of hepatotoxicity. Because of its unique metabolism and relationship to the gastrointestinal tract, the liver is an important target of the toxicity of drugs, xenobiotics, and oxidative stress. In cholestatic disease, endogenously generated bile acids produce hepatocellular apoptosis by stimulating Fas translocation from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane where self-aggregation occurs to trigger apoptosis. Kupffer cell activation and neutrophil infiltration extend toxic injury. Kupffer cells release reactive oxygen species (ROS), cytokines, and chemokines, which induce neutrophil extravasation and activation. The liver expresses many cytochrome P450 isoforms, including ethanol-induced CYP2E1. CYP2E1 generates ROS, activates many toxicologically important substrates, and may be the central pathway by which ethanol causes oxidative stress. In acetaminophen toxicity, nitric oxide (NO) scavenges superoxide to produce peroxynitrite, which then causes protein nitration and tissue injury. In inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) knockout mice, nitration is prevented, but unscavenged superoxide production then causes toxic lipid peroxidation to occur instead. Microvesicular steatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and cytolytic hepatitis involve mitochondrial dysfunction, including impairment of mitochondrial fatty acid {$\beta$}-oxidation, inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, and damage to mitochondrial DNA. Induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) is another mechanism causing mitochondrial failure, which can lead to necrosis from ATP depletion or caspase-dependent apoptosis if ATP depletion does not occur fully. Because of such diverse mechanisms, hepatotoxicity remains a major reason for drug withdrawal from pharmaceutical development and clinical use.},

Results from this approach indicate that substantial intracellular concentration gradients occur under some O2- and ATP-limited conditions. These studies, along with electron microscopic analyses and mathematical modeling, indicate that clustering and distribution of mitochondria are major factors in determining the magnitude and location of the concentration gradients. The mitochondria appear to be clustered in sites of high ATP demand to maximize ATP supply under conditions of limited production. The size of such clusters is limited by the magnitude of the O2 gradient needed to provide adequate O2 concentrations for mitochondrial function within the clusters. Thus microheterogeneity of metabolite concentrations can occur in cells without membranal compartmentation and may be important in determining the rates of various high-flux processes.},

  abstract = {The liver has a multitude of functions which are necessary to maintain whole body homeostasis. This requires that various metabolic pathways can run in parallel in the most efficient manner and that futile cycles are kept to a minimum. To a large extent this is achieved due to a functional specialization of the liver parenchyma known as metabolic zonation which is often lost in liver diseases. Although this phenomenon is known for about 40 years, the underlying regulatory pathways are not yet fully elucidated. The physiologically occurring oxygen gradient was considered to be crucial for the appearance of zonation; however, a number of reports during the last decade indicating that {$\beta$}-catenin signaling, and the hedgehog (Hh) pathway contribute to metabolic zonation may have shifted this view. In the current review we connect these new observations with the concept that the oxygen gradient within the liver acinus is a regulator of zonation. This is underlined by a number of facts showing that the {$\beta$}-catenin and the Hh pathway can be modulated by the hypoxia signaling system and the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs). Altogether, we provide a view by which the dynamic interplay between all these pathways can drive liver zonation and thus contribute to its physiological function.},

The key demonstration of this study was that Zone 1 and Zone 3 microenvironments can be established by controlling the oxygen tension in individual devices over the range of ca. 3 to 13\%. The oxygen tension was computationally modeled using input on the microfluidic device dimensions, numbers of cells, oxygen consumption rates of hepatocytes, the diffusion coefficients of oxygen in different materials and the flow rate of media in the MicroPhysiology System (MPS). In addition, the oxygen tension was measured using a ratiometric imaging method with the oxygen sensitive dye, Tris(2,20-bipyridyl) dichlororuthenium(II) hexahydrate (RTDP) and the oxygen insensitive dye, Alexa 488. The Zone 1 biased functions of oxidative phosphorylation, albumin and urea secretion and Zone 3 biased functions of glycolysis, a1AT secretion, Cyp2E1 expression and acetaminophen toxicity were demonstrated in the respective Zone 1 and Zone 3 MicroPhysiology System. Further improvements in the Liver Acinus MicroPhysiology System included improved performance of selected nonparenchymal cells, the inclusion of a porcine liver extracellular matrix to model the Space of Disse, as well as an improved media to support both hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells. In its current form, the Liver Acinus MicroPhysiology System is most amenable to low to medium throughput, acute through chronic studies, including liver disease models, prioritizing compounds for preclinical studies, optimizing chemistry in structure activity relationship (SAR) projects, as well as in rising dose studies for initial dose ranging.},

These               in vitro               experiments traditionally involve cells cultured in a two-dimensional monolayer environment. However, cells cultured in three-dimensional spheroid systems have been shown to more closely resemble the functionality and morphology of cells               in vivo               . While the increasing usage of hepatic spheroid cultures allows for more relevant experimentation in a more realistic biological environment, the underlying physical processes of drug transport, uptake and metabolism contributing to the spatial distribution of drugs in these spheroids remain poorly understood. The development of a multiscale mathematical modelling framework describing the spatio-temporal dynamics of drugs in multicellular environments enables mechanistic insight into the behaviour of these systems. Here, our analysis of cell membrane permeation and porosity throughout the spheroid reveals the impact of these properties on drug penetration, with maximal disparity between zonal metabolism rates occurring for drugs of intermediate lipophilicity. Our research shows how mathematical models can be used to simulate the activity and transport of drugs in hepatic spheroids and in principle any organoid, with the ultimate aim of better informing experimentalists on how to regulate dosing and culture conditions to more effectively optimize drug delivery.},

Three-dimensional cultures support spatial gradients in nutrients such as oxygen that can be exploited to better represent in vivo gradients that exist along a fundamental sub-unit of liver microarchitecture, the liver sinusoid. The physical and physiological processes that result in the establishment of such gradients can be described mathematically. Quantification of the rates governing these processes and optimisation of cell culture conditions can be performed in silico to better inform experimental design. In this study, we take into account cell line-specific physiological properties, spheroid size and the impact of experimental equipment geometries in order to demonstrate how mathematical models can be optimised to achieve specific in vivo-like features in different scenarios. Furthermore, the sensitivity of such optimised gradients is analysed with respect to culture conditions and considerations are given to prevent the emergence of hypoxic regions in the spheroid. The methodology presented provides an enhanced understanding of the mechanisms of the system within this simulated in vitro framework such that experimental design can be more carefully calibrated when conducting experiments using hepatic spheroids.},

Selective and graded repletion of the extramitochondrial ATP/pool with glucose prevented necrosis and restored the ability of the cells to undergo apoptosis.

A number of papers have suggested that lactate formation during sepsis is not due to hypoxia. I discuss this hypothesis and outline the recent advances in the understanding of lactate metabolism in shock.         Recent findings~         Numerous experimental data have demonstrated that stimulation of aerobic glycolysis \textendash{} that is, glycolysis not attributable to oxygen deficiency \textendash{} and glycogenolysis occurs not only in resting, well-oxygenated skeletal muscles but also during experimental haemorrhagic shock and experimental sepsis, and is closely linked to stimulation of sarcolemmal Na+/K+-ATPase under epinephrine stimulation. A human study of hyperkinetic septic shock demonstrated that skeletal muscle is a leading source of lactate production by exaggerated aerobic glycolysis through Na+/K+-ATPase stimulation.         Summary~         There is increasing evidence that sepsis is accompanied by a hypermetabolic state, with enhanced glycolysis and hyperlactataemia. This should not be rigorously interpreted as an indication of hypoxia. It now appears, at least in the hyperkinetic state, that increased lactate production and concentration as a result of hypoxia are often the exception rather than the rule.},

We found that cells subjected to ATP depletion below {$\sim$}15\% of control died uniformly of necrosis. In contrast, cells subjected to ATP depletion between {$\sim$}25 and 70\% of control all died by apoptosis. The rapidity of cell death was proportional to the severity of reduction of cell ATP content and was independent of the mechanism of cell death. Renal growth factors, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and high-dose insulin, did not ameliorate apoptotic cell death induced by ATP depletion. We conclude that ATP depletion can cause either necrosis or apoptosis in MPT cells.

  abstract = {Through the process of glycolysis, one molecule of glucose breaks down to form two molecules of pyruvate. Depending on the microcellular environment (specifically, oxygen availability, energy demand, and the presence or absence of mitochondria), pyruvate has several separate fates: In mitochondria-containing cells, pyruvate can enter the citric acid cycle within the mitochondrial matrix and undergo~oxidative phosphorylation. Aptly named due to its dependence on oxygen as the final electron acceptor, oxidative phosphorylation cannot take place in the absence of oxygen. Moreover, as the enzymes of both the citric acid cycle and electron transport chain are within the mitochondria, cells lacking mitochondria (e.g., erythrocytes)~cannot rely on oxidative phosphorylation for~energy production. In erythrocytes and oxygen-deprived tissue, pyruvate remains within the cytoplasm~and converts to lactate, a process referred to as anaerobic glycolysis. This final reaction allows for the regeneration of NAD+, a cofactor that must be available in high enough intracellular concentrations for the earlier reactions of glycolysis to remain favorable. Compared to oxidative phosphorylation, however, anaerobic glycolysis is significantly less efficient, providing a net production of only 2 ATP per glucose molecule (versus~32 ATP per glucose molecule produced during oxidative phosphorylation).[1]},

Oligomycin, an inhibitor of the reversible mitochondrial ATP synthase (F1F0-adenosinetriphosphatase), caused dose-dependent cell killing with 0.1 microgram/ml being the minimum concentration causing the maximum cell killing. Oligomycin also caused rapid ATP depletion without causing mitochondrial depolarization. Fructose (20 mM), a potent glycolytic substrate in liver, protected completely against oligomycin toxicity. CCCP (5 microM) also caused rapid killing of hepatocytes. Fructose retarded cell death caused by CCCP but failed to prevent lethal cell injury. Although oligomycin (1.0 microgram/ml) was lethally toxic by itself, in the presence of fructose it protected completely against CCCP-induced cell killing. Cyanide (2.5 mM), an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration, caused rapid cell killing that was reversed by fructose. CCCP completely blocked fructose protection against cyanide, causing mitochondrial depolarization and rapid ATP depletion. In the presence of fructose and cyanide, oligomycin protected cells against CCCP-induced ATP depletion and cell death but did not prevent mitochondrial depolarization. In every instance, cell killing was associated with ATP depletion, whereas protection against lethal cell injury was associated with preservation of ATP. In conclusion, protection by fructose against toxicity of cyanide, oligomycin, and CCCP was mediated by glycolytic ATP formation rather than by preservation of the mitochondrial membrane potential. These findings support the hypothesis that inhibition of cellular ATP formation is a crucial event in the progression of irreversible cell injury.},

Implementation of Organ-Chips within the pharmaceutical industry aims to improve the probability of success of drugs reaching late stage clinical trial by generating models for drug discovery that are of human origin and have disease relevance. We are adopting the use of Organ-Chips for enhancing pre-clinical efficacy and toxicity evaluation and prediction. Whilst capturing cellular phenotype               via               imaging in response to drug exposure is a useful readout in these models, application has been limited due to difficulties in imaging the chips at scale. Here we created an end-to-end, automated workflow to capture and analyse confocal images of multicellular Organ-Chips to assess detailed cellular phenotype across large batches of chips. By automating this process, we not only reduced acquisition time, but we also minimised process variability and user bias. This enabled us to establish, for the first time, a framework of statistical best practice for Organ-Chip imaging, creating the capability of using Organ-Chips and imaging for routine testing in drug discovery applications that rely on quantitative image data for decision making. We tested our approach using benzbromarone, whose mechanism of toxicity has been linked to mitochondrial damage with subsequent induction of apoptosis and necrosis, and staurosporine, a tool inducer of apoptosis. We also applied this workflow to assess the hepatotoxic effect of an active AstraZeneca drug candidate illustrating its applicability in drug safety assessment beyond testing tool compounds. Finally, we have demonstrated that this approach could be adapted to Organ-Chips of different shapes and sizes through application to a Kidney-Chip.},

Human ECV304 cells transiently transfected with MIMS-EYFP showed the typical mitochondrial network, co-localized with MitoTracker Red. Following the calibration procedure, an estimation of the pH value in the intermembrane space was obtained. This value (6.88{$\pm$}0.09) was significantly lower than that determined in the cytosol after transfection with a cytosolic EYFP (7.59{$\pm$}0.01). Further, the pH of the mitochondrial matrix, determined with a EYFP targeted to this subcompartment, was 0.9 pH units higher than that in the intermembrane space.

  abstract = {In this study the effect of metabolism of menadione (2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) on ATP generation in isolated rat hepatocytes was investigated. Menadione-induced cytotoxicity correlated well with the depletion of ATP. Loss of viability lagged approximately 25 min behind the depletion of ATP. Our results suggest that depletion of ATP may be mediated by interference with glycolysis and protein breakdown, resulting in a lack of oxidizable substrates for ATP generation. (i) Menadione reduced proteolysis to 27\% of control after 60 min of incubation. (ii) Increased glycogenolysis was not accompanied by accumulation of glycolytic end-products. The increased levels of glucose 6-phosphate were mainly metabolized to glucose. (iii) Menadione induced a time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, although no accumulation of glycolytic intermediates was found. The data presented suggest that glycolysis may be inhibited upstream of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. (iv) Suppletion of metabolic substrates (pyruvate, oxaloacetate, and glutamine) postponed the menadione-induced ATP depletion and delayed the onset of cell killing. The protecting effect of these metabolic substrates could be reversed by atractyloside, an inhibitor of the ADP/ATP translocase. The temporary protection of metabolic substrates suggests that additional mechanisms (e.g., cofactor depletion, mitochondrial damage, enzyme inactivation) may play a role in menadione-induced ATP depletion. The present study substantiates the critical role of ATP depletion in menadione-induced cell death.},

  abstract = {Most cancer cells rely on glycolysis to generate ATP, even when oxygen is available. However, merely inhibiting the glycolysis is insufficient for the eradication of cancer cells. One main reason for this is that cancer cells have the potential to adapt their metabolism to their environmental conditions. In this study, we investigated how cancer cells modify their intracellular metabolism when glycolysis is suppressed, using PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cells and two other solid tumor cell lines, A549 and HeLa. Our study revealed that glycolytically suppressed cells upregulated mitochondrial function and relied on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to obtain the ATP necessary for their survival. Dynamic changes in intracellular metabolic profiles were also observed, reflected by the reduced levels of TCA cycle intermediates and elevated levels of most amino acids. Glutamine and glutamate were important for this metabolic reprogramming, as these were largely consumed by influx into the TCA cycle when the glycolytic pathway was suppressed. During the reprogramming process, activated autophagy was involved in modulating mitochondrial function. We conclude that upon glycolytic suppression in multiple types of tumor cells, intracellular energy metabolism is reprogrammed toward mitochondrial OXPHOS in an autophagy-dependent manner to ensure cellular survival.},

  abstract = {The cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO               2               ) are major determinants of the contrast in functional magnetic resonance imaging and optical imaging. However, the coupling between CBF and CMRO               2               during cerebral activation remains controversial. Whereas most of the previous models tend to show a nonlinear coupling, experimental studies have led to conflicting conclusions. A physiologic model was developed of oxygen transport through the blood\textendash brain barrier (BBB) for dynamic and stationary states. Common model simplifications are proposed and their implications for the CBF/CMRO               2               relation are studied. The tissue oxygen pool, the BBB permeability, and the hemoglobin dissociation curve are physiologic parameters directly involved in the CBF/CMRO               2               relation. We have been shown that the hypothesis of a negligible tissue oxygen pool, which was admitted by most of the previous models, implies a tight coupling between CBF and CMRO               2               . By relaxing this hypothesis, a real uncoupling was allowed that gives a more coherent view of the CBF/CMRO               2               relation, in better agreement with the hypercapnia data and with the variability reported in experimental works for the relative changes of those two variables. This also allows a temporal mismatch between CBF and CMRO               2               , which influences the temporal shape of oxygenation at the capillary end.},

The levels of {$\Delta\Psi$}m and ATP in the cell are kept relatively stable although there are limited fluctuations of both these factors that can occur reflecting normal physiological activity. However, sustained changes in both factors may be deleterious. A long-lasting drop or rise of {$\Delta\Psi$}mvs normal levels may induce unwanted loss of cell viability and be a cause of various pathologies. Among other factors, {$\Delta\Psi$}m plays a key role in mitochondrial homeostasis through selective elimination of dysfunctional mitochondria. It is also a driving force for transport of ions (other than H+) and proteins which are necessary for healthy mitochondrial functioning. We propose additional potential mechanisms for which {$\Delta\Psi$}m is essential for maintenance of cellular health and viability and provide recommendations how to accurately measure {$\Delta\Psi$}m in a cell and discuss potential sources of artifacts.},
